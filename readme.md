# Hello. It Me.

I'm Beppe, currently working for Belgium Ministry of Finance (FODFin/MinFin) in Service Operations.
This basically means is i get to do almost any field of IT in my job (excluding hardware).
From managing a gitlab instance, building pipelines and messing around with kubernetes to more mundane things like
backing up and restoring databases and configuring vhosts/nginx servers.

# Why is this profile a barren wasteland?

College made me very unmotivated when it comes to programming/anything IT related, however I recently graduated.
Apart from that i'm very self-concious about the code I write, so periodically i'll go on a "privating" streak.
I would put more of my actual work on here, however i'm not allowed :P.
But I'm hoping to pick up more personal projects in the future, which will probably appear here, filled with unoptimized
code and spelling mistakes. :^)
