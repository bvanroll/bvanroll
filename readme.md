# Hello. It Me.

I'm Beppe, currently working for Belgium Ministry of Finance (FODFin/MinFin) in Service Operations.
This basically means is i get to do almost any field of IT in my job (excluding hardware).
From managing a gitlab instance, building pipelines and messing around with kubernetes to more mundane things like
backing up and restoring databases and configuring vhosts/nginx servers.

# Why is this profile a barren wasteland?

College made me very unmotivated when it comes to programming/anything IT related, however I recently graduated.
Apart from that i'm very self-concious about the code I write, so periodically i'll go on a "privating" streak.
I would put more of my actual work on here, however i'm not allowed :P.
But I'm hoping to pick up more personal projects in the future, which will probably appear here, filled with unoptimized
code and spelling mistakes. :^)

# (22/03/2021) Lets not keep this a barren wasteland.

Often these days I am unmotivated to finish personal projects.
I will start (in my opinion) many great idea's and never finish them, ex:
- ai swear filter for streaming
- ai based facial emotion display for vtubers  (show happyness sadness etc based on voice intonation)
- etc.

I believe this is because I already work in a similar field as where my interests lie. 
This means that at the end of the week I usually have very little interest in sitting back down behind a pc again and "working".
Even if I think the result will be nice.

Recently I started reading (I get distracted easily) some article I found on HN: https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing
I only got partially through it so far, but it brought up a good point. 
Even though I did a lot of work at the end of the week, I had nothing to show for it.
For example, in the last month I set up 3 api's for some databases, using vault authentication.
And all 3 times, I set it up purely in house, with the specific use for this situation.

What I could have done instead was:
- make a vault authentication api for dynamic db creds
- make a modular python api framework
- published both of those on my github account

In the future I could then easily reuse these projects, and maybe some other people online might find some use for it.
But whats even more important about this to me, is that it doesn't feel like i'm doing useless work.
The api's I wrote will be replaced some day for something more propriatery and the code will never be used again.


I'm going to start looking into ways of making this work (i don't know if i'm allowed to do this at all in the first place :D)
